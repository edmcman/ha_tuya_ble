    A device that advertises rarely can stay unavailable indefinitely after it
    briefly goes out of range, because nothing reliably retries once it is back:

    - The setup retry backs off to one attempt every 10 minutes, while a remote
      scanner only keeps an advertisement for a few minutes, so a retry usually
      lands in a gap and finds nothing even for a device that is advertising.
    - Home Assistant reloads an entry in the retry state when a bluetooth
      discovery flow fires for its address, but the integration matcher
      remembers an address once it has matched, so that rescue only happens on
      the first matching advertisement after a restart.

    Watching the address directly closes the gap: the entry is reloaded as soon
    as the device is heard from. Registering in a non-passive mode also asks
    scanners that support it to actively scan for this address while the device
    is missing, which is otherwise only requested once the entry is set up.
